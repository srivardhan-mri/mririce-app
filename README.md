# MRI Rice App

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Management

Application data for products, brands, and blog posts is now managed through dedicated JSON files (`products.json`, `brands.json`, `blogs.json`) located in `src/app/services/data/`. This approach centralizes data, improves maintainability, and facilitates dynamic content generation, such as the sitemap.
