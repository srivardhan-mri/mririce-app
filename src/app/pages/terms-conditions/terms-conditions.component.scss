// src/app/pages/terms-conditions/terms-conditions.component.scss

// Most styles for .legal-content-section, h1, h2, p, ul, strong, a
// should be defined in your global src/styles.scss for consistency across legal pages.

// If you need any specific overrides or additional styles ONLY for the terms & conditions page,
// they would go here.

// For now, this can likely remain empty if global styles for .legal-content-section are sufficient.
