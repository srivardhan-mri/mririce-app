As a premier **Non-Basmati Rice Manufacturer** and a leading **Rice Mill in Miryalaguda**, we often guide our partners on the unique qualities of Parboiled, Steam, and Aged Raw Rice. This guide will clarify which type is best for your specific market needs.</p><h2>1. Aged Raw Rice: The Choice for Aroma and Texture</h2><p>Often sought by many as an **Aged Raw Rice Wholesaler**, our process for raw rice is precise. After drying the paddy, we mill it to remove the husk and bran. The key is the aging process, which enhances its cooking qualities.</p><ul><li><strong>Process:</strong> Simple drying, milling, and controlled aging for optimal texture.</li><li><strong>Best Varieties:</strong> **Sona Masuri Rice (BPT-5204)** is a prime example, renowned for its qualities when aged.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> Fluffy, separate grains, making it the **best rice for Biryani (non-basmati)** and pulao. Our premium **SuperFineStar Sona Masuri Rice** is the benchmark for this category, perfect for **hotel supply**.</li></ul><h2>2. Steam Rice: The Versatile All-Rounder</h2><p>Our **Steam Rice Mill** division specializes in this popular variety. Paddy is steamed before milling, a process that toughens the grain, preserves nutrients, and ensures a consistent cooking experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Process:</strong> Gentle steaming of paddy, followed by drying and milling.</li><li><strong>Best Varieties:</strong> **HMT Steam Rice** is a customer favorite for its subtle aroma and non-sticky texture.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> Ideal for daily meals and a top choice for any **catering rice wholesaler**. We offer competitive **Bulk Steam Rice Price** points for large orders.</li></ul><h2>3. Parboiled Rice: The Nutrition and Durability Powerhouse</h2><p>As a trusted **Parboiled Rice Supplier**, this is our area of expertise. The paddy undergoes a hydrothermal treatment (soaking, steaming, drying) before milling. This locks nutrients into the grain and makes it incredibly durable.</p><ul><li><strong>Process:</strong> Soaking, high-pressure steaming, and drying of paddy.</li><li><strong>Best Varieties:</strong> **Sona Masuri Parboiled Rice** and **JSR Rice** are processed this way to meet high-demand markets.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> Nutritionally dense, firm-textured rice with a distinctive golden hue.
